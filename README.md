## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Global Terrorism

**Tools Used**:- Excel, Power BI




## Problem Statement
This project is concerned with global terrorism data that is over the past few decades, what is the situation of the terrorism all over the globe. on the basis of the dataset, you have to build a dashboard to visualize the analysis of global terrorism.




## Steps followed 
1 ***Imported the Excel Terrorism Database into Power BI.***

2 ***Removed Unwanted Columns.***

3 ***Cleaned the data to handle missing values and outliers.***

4 ***At Last built a dashboard with Cards, Charts, slicers and Filters etc.***



***I have created a Power BI dashboard to analyze global terrorism data, with a focus on total attacks by year, success rate by attack type, target type, weapon type, country, region, and Top 5 terrorist group. The dashboard also includes a slicer for Year, country and Name of the group and cards for the Total Target, most deadly group, total killed people, most common attack type, most used weapon type, Most attacked country.***
